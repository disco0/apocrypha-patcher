# > Can I embed the fonts into a game, application or device Iâ€™m developing based on the document
# > font embedding permissions?
#
# No, document font embedding permissions relate to embedding fonts in documents only, not embedding
# fonts in games, apps and devices.
#
# > If I convert the font into a bitmap font can I include that in my game or app?
#
# No, converting Windows fonts to other formats does not change the rules around embedding or
# redistribution, and format conversion itself is not allowed. Many Microsoft supplied fonts are
# available for app and game licensing through the original font foundry or Monotype.
